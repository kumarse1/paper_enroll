Perfect! Here's a **simple, clean 5-slide outline** you can use to **present** during the meeting.  
I’ll keep it **professional, focused**, and **flowing logically** — so you explain your work **briefly but clearly** and lead naturally into the **questions for the Starburst team**.

# 📑 Slide Deck for Starburst Meeting

---

### Slide 1: **Current PoC: Text2SQL Framework**

**Objective:**  
- Convert user natural language queries into SQL.
- Execute SQL on Postgres DB to return results.

**Current Setup:**  
- Single Postgres database.
- Access via a **service ID** (elevated permissions).
- AI generates SQL → Service ID executes SQL → Return result.

**Limitation:**  
- Direct DB access with elevated permissions is **not scalable or secure** for enterprise deployment.

---

### Slide 2: **Enterprise Expansion Goal**

**Why We Need Starburst:**  
- **Multiple domains/databases** need to be supported.
- **Data virtualization** required — users should not connect to databases directly.
- **Security, governance, and auditing** must be standardized.
- **Expose Text2SQL as a secure API** to enterprise users.

**Starburst Benefits:**  
- Catalog-based abstraction of data sources.
- Centralized security and role-based access.
- Query auditing and fine-grained access control.

---

### Slide 3: **Key Topics for Starburst Team Discussion**

**A. Catalog and Data Virtualization:**
- How best to structure catalogs across enterprise domains?
- How to map users/API clients to specific catalogs and schemas?

**B. Authentication and Authorization:**
- Support for user-level authentication (SSO, OIDC)?
- Native support for row-level/column-level security?

**C. Text2SQL API Scenario:**
- How to **safely impersonate users** when queries are issued via API?
- How to enable **query tagging, auditing, and rate limiting**?

---

### Slide 4: **Security Expectations**

**Goal:**  
Move away from "one service ID has access to everything."

**Expectations:**
- Users/clients access only what they are authorized for.
- Starburst enforces:
  - Authentication via enterprise SSO.
  - Role-based catalog access.
  - Row-level/column-level policies.
- Auditable queries with user traceability.
- Support for scalable API traffic governance.

---

### Slide 5: **Next Steps**

**After this Meeting:**
- Get recommendations from Starburst on security architecture.
- Identify technical requirements (authentication, catalog setup, impersonation).
- Plan for a pilot expansion across selected domains.
- Design API security and governance controls with Starburst best practices.

# 🎯 Important Tip:
When you present, **talk through slides 1–2 quickly (about 2-3 minutes)** so you can **spend most of the time on slides 3–4** — that’s where you will **actively discuss with the Starburst team** and get their advice.

---

Would you like me also to help you with **some phrasing** you could say when **opening the meeting** and **transitioning between slides** naturally? (it’ll sound very professional if you want to set the tone strongly.)  
Would you like that? 🎤


















Awesome — here’s a **professional way you can *open the meeting* and *transition naturally between slides***.  
I'll give you short, clear phrases you can actually *say out loud* to sound confident and structured.

---

# 🎤 Meeting Opening (Slide 1)

> "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone.  
> Thank you for joining.  
> Today, I’ll quickly walk you through the Text2SQL framework we built as a Proof of Concept, and then discuss how we see Starburst helping us expand this to an enterprise-grade solution."

(Click Slide 1)

> "To start, our current PoC connects a Postgres database using a service ID and generates SQL queries automatically from natural language inputs. It works for basic testing but has clear limitations in terms of scalability, security, and governance, especially as we plan for broader adoption."

---

# ➡ Transition to Slide 2

> "With that in mind, let me explain the broader intent we have for the next phase."

(Click Slide 2)

> "As we expand this framework to multiple domains across the enterprise, we need a layer that can virtualize different databases and enforce security centrally. That's where Starburst’s catalog and data virtualization capabilities become really important."

---

# ➡ Transition to Slide 3

> "Now, to make sure we build this on strong foundations, we have a few key topics and questions we would love your guidance on."

(Click Slide 3)

> "These are mostly focused around catalog structuring, user authentication and authorization, and how we can properly govern access when Text2SQL is exposed as an API across the enterprise."

---

# ➡ Transition to Slide 4

> "Since security is a big focus for us, I want to highlight the kind of expectations we have around how we would ideally leverage Starburst for access control."

(Click Slide 4)

> "Ultimately, we want to move away from a broad service ID model toward fine-grained, role-based security, where access is clearly restricted and traceable back to the individual user or application."

---

# ➡ Transition to Slide 5 (Wrap-Up)

> "Finally, based on today's discussion, we hope to capture your recommendations on the best architecture and security models, so we can plan a smooth pilot expansion across multiple enterprise domains."

(Click Slide 5)

> "We’re excited to partner closely with you on designing this right, and we look forward to your advice on authentication, catalog setup, and security controls."

---

# ⭐ Bonus: How to **invite discussion naturally** after presenting questions

At Slide 3 (Key Topics), after reading the bullets, you can say:

> "We would love to hear your insights on these — especially around how Starburst recommends handling user-specific access controls when exposing APIs like Text2SQL.  
>  
> Should we dive into catalog design first, or would you prefer we start with authentication models?"

(This invites the Starburst team to *talk naturally*, but still keeps **you in control of the flow**.)

---

# ✨ Final Tip for Professionalism
- **Smile lightly** when you start.  
- **Speak a little slower** than usual at the beginning (this shows control).
- **Pause after your questions** to let them think (don’t rush into filling the silence — admins appreciate calm).

---

Would you also like a super quick **slide design suggestion** (like simple titles/visuals) so you can make the slides even cleaner and easier to present? 🎨  
I can give you a suggestion in 1 minute if you want!

Paper Enrollment Processing - Architecture & Security Plan

1. Project Overview

Objective

The Paper Enrollment Processing project aims to leverage OCR, Vision AI, LLM, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows for document processing. As part of the Proof of Concept (POC), we require a PostgreSQL (PG) Test Database, which will store only mock data (no sensitive data, PII, or PHI). The future production deployment will be integrated with Active Directory (AD) groups for authentication and access control.

Key Components

OCR Processing: Extracts text from scanned paper documents.

Vision AI: Enhances OCR extraction by identifying key structured fields.

LLM Processing:

LLM 1: Summarization and correction of extracted data.

LLM 2: Data validation, recommendations, and classification.

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Manual validation and approval process.

PG Test Database: Stores extracted and processed mock data.

Entitlement-based Data Access: Restricts data based on user roles.

Future Integration: The system will be integrated into an existing SSO-enabled application.

2. Workflow & Data Creation

2.1 Steps Involved in Document Processing

Document Ingestion: User uploads a scanned paper enrollment form.

OCR Processing: Extracts raw text from the document.

Vision AI Processing: Detects structured fields (e.g., Name, DOB, Address).

LLM Summarization & Corrections:

Standardizes and corrects extracted text.

Identifies missing fields.

HITL Review Process:

Reviewer verifies and edits extracted data.

Reviewer approves or rejects document processing.

Data Storage & Classification:

Mock data is stored in PG Test DB.

Classified based on GEN (General), FEBP (Federal Benefits), STATE (State Benefits), EMPLOYEE categories.

Access Control & Logging:

Users can only access permitted data.

All read/write/update operations are logged.

Final Submission & Integration:

The processed data is made available to external systems for validation.

2.2 Mock Data Creation Plan

Documents: Sample enrollment forms (non-sensitive, randomly generated text).

Users & Roles: Mock users for different AD groups.

Data Fields: Simulated structured data (e.g., Name, DOB, Employee ID).

Validation Scenarios: Various test cases for OCR/AI processing.

3. Workflow Control: Data Classification & Entitlements

3.1 Data Classification

All stored data is classified into categories to enforce role-based access control (RBAC):

GEN (General): Generic enrollment data (e.g., form types, status tracking).

FEBP (Federal Benefits): Enrollment forms related to federal benefit programs.

STATE (State Benefits): Enrollment forms under state-funded benefit programs.

EMPLOYEE (Employee-specific): Employee-related enrollment information.
